# Introduction for APEX API Developers

APEX API Developer Portal is a self-service web-based portal that enables API consumers to consume APIs that are listed.
You (as a developer) can register and manage your user profile, register applications, manage application credentials, browse APIs and supporting documentation, monitor application API usage, and so on.

## Getting Started

APEX Cloud supports multiple modes for different specific groups of users.
Public Officers will transact with the APEX Cloud through the [API Manager Portal](https://manager.api.developer.tech.gov.sg/) via their TechPass account.
Non-government users however, will have to use their own CorpPass accounts to transact with APEX Cloud through the [API Developer Portal](https://www.api.developer.tech.gov.sg/).
