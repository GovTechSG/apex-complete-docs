# Publishing APIs via the API Manager

APEX Cloud is a cloud-based centralised gateway for government agencies to expose their APIs to registered developers or agencies. As a **publisher**, you can:

1. Create and publish APIs.
2. Configure security policy and manage access to the APIs.
3. Monitor the API traffics and logs.

Login to the **API Manager** with your TechPass account to get started.

> If you do not have a TechPass account, or new to the API Manager, you may refer to our [onboarding guide](sections/onboarding/techpass).
