# Publishing APIs

## Get started

As a **Publisher**, you can [access the API Manager Portal](#access-the-api-manager-portal) to create, publish, and manage APIs.


## Access the API Manager Portal

Select an API Manager Portal environment below and log in  with your [TechPass account]((sections/onboarding/introduction?id=techpass-for-public-officers).).
