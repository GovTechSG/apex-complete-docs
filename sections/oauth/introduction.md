# APEX Cloud OAuth 2.1 (Payroll Initiative)

## Introduction

This user guide is intended for API Publishers and Developers (Consumers).

This guide explains how to implement the [OAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749) [2.1](https://oauth.net/2.1/) Authorization Code Flow to allow a Corpass user to grant a third-party client application access to the Corppass userâ€™s
protected resources.

The guide provides step-by-step instructions for a Client Application Developer to simulate the Corpass User and develop the Authorization Code Flow.
