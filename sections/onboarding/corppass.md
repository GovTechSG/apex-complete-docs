# Onboarding for Non-Government Users

## What is Corppass?

Corppass is a corporate digital identity for entities to conduct online transactions with agencies. Local entities with Unique Entity Number (UEN) and foreign entities are both eligible for Corppass.

## Onboard to Corppass

You may view the onboarding instructions for Corppass [here](https://www.developer.tech.gov.sg/products/categories/digital-identity/corppass/overview.html).

For other administrative instructions, like managing your Corppass account, you may refer to the common user guides [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/userguides).

!> **Important:** Before a Corppass user can onboard to APEX Cloud and use the API Developer Portal, a **Corppass Admin (or Sub-Admin**) will need to assign the user to have access to APEX Cloud's e-Service: `Apex Cloud`. You may refer to the assignment documentation [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/help/CP_User_Guide_05A_Admin_Subadmin_Set_Up_Assign_Users_Digital_Service_Access.pdf).

## Log in to the API Developer Portal

Once you have a valid and active Corppass account, you may log into the [API Developer Portal](https://www.api.developer.tech.gov.sg/) and verify your API Developer account.

?> **Note:** You will have to change your default email address upon first login before you can transact with the APEX Cloud platform.
