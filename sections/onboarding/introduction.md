### TechPass for Public Officers

Public Officers and users representing government agencies access APEX Cloud using [TechPass](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/). 

> **Already have a TechPass account?** You can proceed to [log in to the API Manager Portals  as a new user](#verify-your-techpass-account).

1. Follow the steps in the [TechPass User Guide](https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/techpass-user-guide/onboard-to-techpass) to onboard.

    > **Important**: In order to access the protected endpoint of the API Manager(s), you must **select the option to onboard your Internet device to SEED** during the TechPass onboarding.

2. Once you have a valid TechPass account and a device with  SEED enabled, you may proceed to verify your TechPass account by logging in to all the API Manager Portals in the following environments:
    - [Staging (external)](https://go.gov.sg/apex-stg)
    - [Staging (internal)](https://go.gov.sg/apex-int-stg)
    - [Production (external)](https://go.gov.sg/apex)
    - [Production (internal)](https://go.gov.sg/apex-int)

    Verifying your account in all environments is a **required** step as it will create your user account within the Manager portal.

3. You can now onboard to APEX Cloud. Select one of the following:
    - [Onboard as a Publisher](/sections/onboarding/publisher-onboarding.md)
    - [Onboard as a Consumer](/sections/onboarding/developer-onboarding.md)

### Corppass for non-government users

Non-government or external users can access APEX Cloud using [Corppass](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/userguides).

2. For other administrative instructions, like managing your Corppass account, you may refer to the common user guides [here](https://www.corppass.gov.sg/corppass/common/userguides).

    > **Important:** Before a Corppass user can onboard to APEX Cloud and use the API Developer Portal, a **Corppass Admin (or Sub-Admin**) will need to assign the user to have access to APEX Cloud's e-Service: `APEX Cloud`.
