# Subscribing applications to APIs

Before an API key of an application can be allowed entry to access an API, it first has to be subscribed to that API. You may begin this workflow by navigating through:

`Applications` &rarr; `Clicking on [Application of choice]` &rarr; `API Access Tab`

By clicking on the `Manage API Subscriptions` button, you will be prompted to select an API (that your organization has access to) to subscribe to.

!> If your organization has not requested access to (or have published) any APIs, then there will be no APIs present to select. See our guide on [browsing APIs](/sections/consuming/browsing-apis.md) to learn more on finding the right APIs for your use-cases.

Upon submitting the modal form, your application will be subscribed to the API. You may repeat this steps multiple times if you required access to multiple APIs.
