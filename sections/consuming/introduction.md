# Consuming APIs

APEX Cloud is a self-service web-based portal that enables API consumers to consume APIs that are listed.
You (as a developer) can create and manage application with its credentials, browse APIs and their relevant supporting documentation, and so on.

In this section, we will cover the [creation of applications](/sections/consuming/create-application.md), [generating API Keys](/sections/consuming/api-keys.md) and [subscribing of APIs](/sections/consuming/subscribe-api.md) for the created applications.

If you have already done the above setup, you may proceed to the next sections:
