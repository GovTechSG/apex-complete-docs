# Browsing APIs

APEX Cloud lets you connect and explore existing APIs that have been published to our API Gateway. Here you have the 2 modes of API viewing:

## 1. Discover APIs through the API Catalog

These APIs are often sandbox APIs that the publishers has shared with the community as a whole for developers to discover and see if the API fits their development requirement.

By clicking through the API in the Catalog, you may typically find instructions on requesting production access to the live API.

Once the Publishing Organization of the API approves your request to allow access to the live API, you will find the API in the Approved APIs page, which is the next mode of API viewing.

## 2. View and subscribe to APIs in the Approved API list

The Approved APIs page contains a list of the APIs that are accessible to your organization(s). Here, because you as the developer has access to these APIs, you may subscribe [applications](/sections/consuming/introduction.md) to the API.
